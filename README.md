# Getting started with Putget Temperature

This guide reviews the steps required to get Putget working on an mbed OS platform.

Please install [mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).

## Import the example application

From the command-line, import the example:

```
mbed import ccb24_a1
cd ccb24_a1
```

### Now compile

Invoke `mbed compile`, and specify the name of your platform and your favorite toolchain (`GCC_ARM`, `ARM`, `IAR`). For example, for the ARM Compiler 5:

```
mbed compile -m K64F -t ARM
```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code. At the end, you see the following result:

```

### Program your board

1. Connect your mbed device to the computer over USB.
2. Connect your mbed device to the Internet over Ethernet.
3. Copy the binary file to the mbed device.
4. Press the reset button to start the program.

The LCD on your platform turns on and it starts sending and receiving the temperature data.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems, you can review the [documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tutorials/debugging.html) for suggestions on what could be wrong and how to fix it.
